February 2020 and I handed in my notice at Substrakt. My time had, unfortunately, come to an end there and it was time to move on. 

In truth, I had made the decision to leave in December of 2019 after applying to work at GitLab but being offered a role there in February solidified the decision. In the 2 years leading up to that point, the company had adopted GitLab as its source control and CI solution and part of my role was administering our GitLab self-managed installation. A role I ended up enjoying possibly rather too much. I really enjoyed using the software and during my time of being a _customer_ of GitLab I guest authored a blog post for them and spent _way_ too much time reading through the company handbook.

The company I was working for at the time was very flexible. I hate to describe any company as a "family", but Substrakt felt like the closest it could be to working for a family in a genuinely positive way. We even had most of the same characters that every family has. We had embraced many remote working practices, I had moved to only working in the office 2 days a week and that went up to full-time home working in January 2020 as world events took a turn for the worse but the GitLab handbook made me crave something even more.

Their relentless focus on _asynchronous_ working. A truly _all-remote_ culture where you are measured on nothing more than your company impact. Nobody has an office; not even the C-Suite. Hours worked counted for nothing. A relentless focus on _getting shit done_, a radical level of trust in its employees to deliver but without all of the overworking culture of the rest of big tech. Put in your 40 hours, work hard, help your colleagues do the same.

Their focus on being as transparent as possible, building everything in the open, making meeting recordings available to everyone in the world. Everyone had a voice on every decision it seemed, even if only one person was directly responsible for its impact.

_I really really wanted that._ I wanted to be a part of it. I saw it (and still do) as the future of work.

I applied, and was offered a role as a Senior Backend Engineer. _Yay!_ Now was the moment to find out if this was all as good as the handbook made it seem, or if I'd been duped by classic corporate values-washing. The short version is: no. It was as good as I had been led to believe. My team was truly asynchronous. My manager was based in Texas, engineers across India, the UK, the US, New Zealand and others. There was never any expectation to attend any meeting in person, except my weekly 1:1 with my manager. Meetings were recorded, notes taken to catch up on later. Conversations happened in GitLab Issues. Discussions on code changes happened in merge requests, _in public_ for the whole world to see. **This was it. I had made it.**

The idea that good collaboration can _only happen when physicaly co-located_ which _I_ knew was untrue, turned out to be **untrue.**

None of this is important though. You can see online in countless articles, blogs, handbook pages about how great GitLab's remote culture is. It doesn't come easily, but it's there and I doubt there are many companies that do it as well as we do. I don't have much to add on the writing already done on the subject.

How has it changed my life though? IC, backend engineer, living in a suburb outside of the UK's second-biggest city? Why did I aspire to this way of working so strongly? 

## Commute

My commute was previously, mercifully, short in distance. Although unreasonably stressful for the distance. My office was based in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter. Approximately 7 miles from my home. Door-to-door though, this journey would typically take 45-60 minutes in each directly. It would cost £80/month and be on trains that were older than me. The monthly cost has since increased with inflation each January.

4 years of commuting, including inflation-busting price rises, would've cost me approximately £4000.

In terms of time, let's assume a 2 hour daily roundtrip commute. 5 working days a week. 47 working weeks a year. 4 years.

That's **1,880** commute hours over the past 4 years. That's **over two and a half months of my life** no longer spent sat on trains, and waiting to walk through ticket barriers. Not to mention all of the money I no longer spend on terrible coffee.

## Health

That time I've regained, along with the hyper-flexibility of remote work mean I've been able to put in to my own health. I run during my lunch breaks, I lift weights in off-peak times at the gym, _I go to therapy_. All things I would not have time, or energy, to do after leaving home at 8am and returning home at 6pm.

_My wife is a person who can get up and run 6 miles at 5:30am before work. I have yet to discover this ability._ 

## Community/Personally

The biggest argument against remote work I hear again and again is "What about the comraderie?", "What about the sense of community?", or the absolutely illogical conclusion "Lots of people meet their spouses in the office! We're depriving a generation of people from meeting their potential soulmate by choosing remote work." (Yeah, seriously. Like big tech set up its beautiful Bay Area offices with all of its conveniences so that twenty-somethings could find dating easier.)

To which I say this: True work/life balance requires that my work and life are actually separate. I want my friends to be people that I genuinely love; not people who happened to pass the same job interview as me. I want it to be people who I want to spend time with. Don't get me wrong, it's totally possible to make lifelong friends at work (I have!), but let's not pretend that it's the only way we can make friends and build community. 

For me, this has meant being much more involved in my _local_ community and far less involved in my city's central community and I far prefer it that way. As a result of spending _way_ more time in my actual, physical, local community I took on volunteer roles as a charity trustee in my local park, and as a governor as my local school as well as visiting a hyper-local co-working space of other people in a similar employment situation to me. All things I would never have done had I still been commuting to an office every day. I recognise the people I see in my community every day, walking my dogs and no longer share awkward smiles with people who's faces I saw every day on trains but never got to know.

My community is thriving in a way that it never did before remote work became commonplace. Local businesses are thriving because money is staying locally and not ending up in the pockets of chain coffee shops that dominate our city centre.

## Conclusion

The corporate world is, unfortunately, pushing workers back to the office. Honestly, I don't really know why. None of the reasons that are given hold up to any sort of scrutiny. The tech world seems to be resisting it, with a few notable exceptions. Long may that continue.

I'm off to walk my dogs at 11am on a Friday because I've had a ridiculously productive morning and I have a meeting with someone in New York at 1pm.
